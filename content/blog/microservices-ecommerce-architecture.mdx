## Introduction

In today's fast-paced digital commerce landscape, building scalable and maintainable ecommerce platforms is crucial for business success. This project demonstrates how to architect a robust microservices-based ecommerce system using modern technologies like Go, gRPC, GraphQL, and Docker.

The platform addresses common challenges in monolithic ecommerce applications: tight coupling, difficulty scaling individual components, technology lock-in, and complex deployments. By breaking down the system into focused microservices, we achieve better separation of concerns, independent scalability, and technology diversity.

### Key Problems Solved

- Independent scaling of critical business functions
- Technology flexibility across different services
- Fault isolation and improved system resilience
- Faster development cycles with autonomous teams
- Database optimization per service requirements

## System Architecture & Design

_High-level architecture showing service interactions and data flow_

The architecture follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles, organizing services around business capabilities rather than technical layers. Each service owns its data and exposes well-defined APIs for inter-service communication.

### Core Services

#### Account Service

Manages user authentication, authorization, and profile management.

- User registration and login
- JWT token management
- Role-based access control
- Profile updates and preferences

#### Catalog Service

Handles product information, search, and inventory management.

- Product CRUD operations
- Full-text search with Elasticsearch
- Inventory tracking
- Category management

#### Order Service

Processes orders, payments, and maintains order history.

- Order creation and validation
- Payment processing integration
- Order status tracking
- Transaction history

#### GraphQL Gateway

Unified API entry point aggregating data from all services.

- Schema stitching and federation
- Request routing and aggregation
- Authentication middleware
- Rate limiting and caching

### Communication Patterns

The system uses gRPC for internal service-to-service communication, providing type safety, better performance, and automatic code generation. GraphQL serves as the external API gateway, offering clients a flexible query interface.

#### Why gRPC?

- **Performance:** Binary protocol with HTTP/2 multiplexing
- **Type Safety:** Protocol Buffers provide strong typing
- **Code Generation:** Automatic client/server code generation
- **Streaming:** Built-in support for bidirectional streaming

## Tech Stack & Infrastructure

### Backend Technologies

- **Go (Golang):** High-performance, concurrent programming
- **Gin Framework:** Lightweight HTTP web framework
- **gRPC:** Inter-service communication protocol
- **GraphQL:** Flexible API gateway layer
- **Protocol Buffers:** Data serialization

### Data & Infrastructure

- **PostgreSQL:** Primary database for Account & Order services
- **Elasticsearch:** Search engine for Catalog service
- **Docker:** Containerization and orchestration
- **Docker Compose:** Multi-container application management
- **Redis:** Caching and session storage

### Sample Code: gRPC Service Definition

```protobuf
// account.proto
syntax = "proto3";

package account;

service AccountService {
  rpc CreateUser(CreateUserRequest) returns (UserResponse);
  rpc GetUser(GetUserRequest) returns (UserResponse);
  rpc UpdateUser(UpdateUserRequest) returns (UserResponse);
  rpc DeleteUser(DeleteUserRequest) returns (DeleteUserResponse);
  rpc AuthenticateUser(AuthRequest) returns (AuthResponse);
}

message CreateUserRequest {
  string email = 1;
  string password = 2;
  string first_name = 3;
  string last_name = 4;
}

message UserResponse {
  string id = 1;
  string email = 2;
  string first_name = 3;
  string last_name = 4;
  string created_at = 5;
  string updated_at = 6;
}

message AuthRequest {
  string email = 1;
  string password = 2;
}

message AuthResponse {
  string token = 1;
  string user_id = 2;
  bool success = 3;
}
```

## Challenges & Solutions

### 1. Service Discovery & Communication

**Challenge:** Services need to discover and communicate with each other dynamically, especially in containerized environments where IP addresses change frequently.

**Solution:** Implemented a service registry pattern using Docker Compose networking and environment-based configuration. Each service registers itself with known endpoints.

```go
// Service discovery configuration
type ServiceConfig struct {
    AccountService  string `json:"account_service"`
    CatalogService  string `json:"catalog_service"`
    OrderService    string `json:"order_service"`
}

func NewServiceDiscovery() *ServiceConfig {
    return &ServiceConfig{
        AccountService: os.Getenv("ACCOUNT_SERVICE_URL"),
        CatalogService: os.Getenv("CATALOG_SERVICE_URL"),
        OrderService:   os.Getenv("ORDER_SERVICE_URL"),
    }
}
```

### 2. Data Consistency Across Services

**Challenge:** Maintaining data consistency when operations span multiple services, especially for order processing that involves inventory updates and payment processing.

**Solution:** Implemented the Saga pattern for distributed transactions, using compensating actions for rollback scenarios and event-driven communication.

```go
// Order processing saga
func (s *OrderSaga) ProcessOrder(order *Order) error {
    // Step 1: Reserve inventory
    if err := s.catalogService.ReserveItems(order.Items); err != nil {
        return err
    }

    // Step 2: Process payment
    if err := s.paymentService.ProcessPayment(order.Payment); err != nil {
        // Compensate: Release inventory
        s.catalogService.ReleaseItems(order.Items)
        return err
    }

    // Step 3: Create order record
    if err := s.orderService.CreateOrder(order); err != nil {
        // Compensate: Refund payment and release inventory
        s.paymentService.RefundPayment(order.Payment)
        s.catalogService.ReleaseItems(order.Items)
        return err
    }

    return nil
}
```

### 3. Database per Service Optimization

**Challenge:** Each service requires different data access patterns: ACID transactions for orders, full-text search for products, and user session management.

**Solution:** Chose optimal database technologies per service: PostgreSQL for transactional data, Elasticsearch for search, and Redis for caching and sessions.

## Lessons Learned & Future Improvements

### Key Lessons

- **Start Simple:** Begin with fewer services and extract more as the system grows
- **Observability First:** Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring from day one
- **Contract Testing:** gRPC schemas provide excellent API contracts between services
- **Database Choice Matters:** Right tool for the right job significantly impacts performance

### Future Enhancements

- **Event Sourcing:** Implement for better audit trails and temporal queries
- **CQRS Pattern:** Separate read/write models for complex queries
- **Kubernetes Migration:** Move from Docker Compose to K8s for production
- **API Gateway:** Add Kong or Envoy for advanced routing and policies

### Version Management Insight

One key decision was using stable, older versions of Go and dependencies rather than bleeding-edge releases. This approach proved invaluable for a multi-component system with gRPC, GraphQL, PostgreSQL, Docker Compose, and Elasticsearch. When you're a solo developer managing multiple moving parts, stability trumps the latest features. This strategy minimized unexpected issues and allowed focus on business logic rather than debugging version conflicts.
