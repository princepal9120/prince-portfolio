# Building AI Agents with LangGraph and Groq

_A step-by-step guide to creating autonomous, reasoning-based AI agents using LangGraph and the Groq API._

---

## 🧠 Introduction

AI Agents have moved from simple prompt-response systems to **autonomous reasoning entities** that can plan, act, and adapt.  
In this article, we’ll build a small **LangGraph-based AI Agent** that uses the **Groq API** for ultra-fast LLM inference.

### Why LangGraph + Groq?

![Alt text for accessibility](/project/agent.png)

- **LangGraph** gives you graph-based control over agent flows.
- **Groq** provides extremely low-latency LLM responses (up to 500 tokens/sec).
- Combined, they let you **design, visualize, and scale** AI reasoning pipelines.

## ⚙️ Setup

Before coding, make sure you have:

```bash
pip install langchain langgraph groq
```
